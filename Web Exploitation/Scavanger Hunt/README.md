## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/. Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Approach

1. When opening the website, we get prompted with two tabs and two short descriptions. The second tab's description says "I used these to make this site: HTML, CSS, JS (JavaScript)". Let's have a look on how this website was made using __view-source__ (CTRL+U on most browsers - If you can't open it put this in your URL bar view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/).
2. The first part of the flag is given as an HTML comment: `picoCTF{t`.
3. Next, we open the CSS file used for this website, finding the second part of the flag, again as a comment: `h4ts_4_l0`.
4. We then open the JS file used for this website, finding a comment that says "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?". This gives out a hint for next file to look for, __robots.txt__ (if you don't know what it is, search it on the Internet), which gives out the third part of the flag: `t_0f_pl4c`.
5. This file also contains another hint to the next thing to search for: "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?". A common used Apache file is __.htaccess__, which defines rules that the server must follow. To access this file, do the same thing you did in order to access the previous one. This file contains next part of the flag `3s_2_lO0k` along with another hint: "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."
6. In MacOS, the Desktop icon layout is stored in a .DS_Store file. Accessing this file reveals the last part of the flag: `_35844447}`
