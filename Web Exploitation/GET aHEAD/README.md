# GET aHEAD

## Overview

* Points: 20
* Category: Web Exploitation
* Author: Madstacks

## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/

## Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

## Approach

1. The title of the challenge gives a hint on the topic of the challenge: HTTP methods.
2. After opening the URL given in the description, open the inspection tools (CTRL+U on most browsers) to check out the HTML code of the web page. You can see that the page is made up of two HTML forms, each containing a different method: the first one uses GET, the second one uses POST.
3. The first hint of the challenge and the title itself give out the solution: you must perform an HTTP request using the HEAD method.
4. You can use tools like Burpsuite or Postman to easily forge an HEAD request, or in this case you can simply run `curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/` in your terminal
